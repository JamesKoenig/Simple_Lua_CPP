    A simple program to extend C++ with lua, and to extend lua with C++
        at the same time!

    A friend asked how I did this so I just decided to upload it to Github

Notes:
    if you're going to use something other than clang++ just change the CC
    line in the Makefile. it should work with g++ as-is
